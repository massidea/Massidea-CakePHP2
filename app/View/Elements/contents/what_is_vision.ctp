	<h2>What is a vision?</h2>
	<div class="box-content">
		<p>Visions of the future or foresight, concern the long-term futures that are usually at least 10 years away.</p>
		<p>Vision can be a future scenario, trend or anti-trend, which is most likely expected to be realized in the long run.</p>
		<p>It can also describe alternative future based on seed of change or a weak signal, which might significantly change our life to unexpected path.</p>
		<p>Visions identify opportunities and threats and help generating new ideas. Ideas founded on vision are more likely resulting radical innovations.</p>
